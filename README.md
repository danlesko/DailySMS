# DailySMS
Anastasia M. B. is the inspiration for this project. 

## Local setup requires you to have your own Twilio account and follow the setup steps found here:
- https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python-msg-svc

### More to come...

### Add your own `src/credentials/config.py` file like so:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

account_sid = 'someString'
auth_token = 'someString'
messaging_service_sid = 'someString'
stasia_number = '+ some number starting with, must start with +1 for US numbers'

```
